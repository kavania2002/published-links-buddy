# Privacy Policy for Published Links Manager Extension

**Effective Date:** 23rd January 2024

## Introduction

This privacy policy explains how the Published Links Manager Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects user data. By using the Extension, we agree to the practices described in this policy.

## Information We Collect

The Extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data or sensitive information. All data processing occurs locally on your device. Specifically:

1. The Extension observes web pages on supported platforms (e.g., Claude, GPT) to detect link generation events.
2. The Extension listens for button clicks and monitors specific elements on the page to identify published or shared links.
3. Links detected are saved to the Extension's local **IndexedDB** storage for your personal use.

## How Your Data is Used

- **Local Storage Only**: All saved links are stored locally on your device using IndexedDB.
- **No External Transmission**: The Extension does not send any data to external servers, third-party services, or the developers of this Extension.

## Permissions

To provide its functionality, the Extension requires:

1. **Host Permissions**: Access to specific domains (e.g., `https://claude.ai/*`, `https://chatgpt.com/*`) to detect link generation events.
2. **SidePanel Permissions**: To enable a user interface for searching and managing links.

These permissions are strictly limited to the intended functionality and do not grant access to unrelated activities or personal information.

## Your Data and Privacy

We respect your privacy and ensure that:

- No data is shared with the Extension developers or any third parties.
- No data is collected beyond what is necessary to detect and save published links.
- You have full control over your saved links and can manage or delete them at any time.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Effective Date" at the top of this document. We encourage you to review the policy periodically to stay informed.
